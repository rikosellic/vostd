# Proof Engineering

### Complete external contracts

<!-- guideline: complete-external-contracts -->

Before adding or changing an `assume_specification`, check each contract clause
against the source code, API documentation, and relevant comments of the exact
dependency version in use. Resolve discrepancies before trusting the model;
successful verification of callers does not establish the contract's soundness.

An external specification must state every caller obligation and every semantic
fact on which a proof relies: preconditions, postconditions, well-formedness, and panic behavior.

For example, a `BTreeMap::get_mut` model must preserve entries other than the
selected key and must express the documented compatibility between the stored
key ordering and borrowed-key ordering. Exclude documented panic conditions with
explicit preconditions, such as capacity or index bounds, rather than merely
marking the operation `may_panic`. Do not claim `no_unwind` while a panic remains
possible under the preconditions.

Use the library's actual representation limits when modeling size bounds. For
example, the `bitvec` model reviewed in PR #742 bounds bit length and capacity by
`usize::MAX / 8`, not just `usize::MAX`. Keep constructor and mutation
preconditions consistent with the model's length bound.

### Centralize trusted boundaries

<!-- guideline: centralize-trusted-boundaries -->

Put unavoidable specifications for opaque standard-library or third-party APIs
under `verified_libs/vstd_extra/src/external/`, not beside OSTD callers.
Centralization does not establish soundness: give unsafe helpers contracts that
justify their callers and delete unused helpers.

Prefer `assume_specification`, matching the original generic signature, trait
bounds, and associated types. Before adding an external function wrapper, test
the direct form with the active toolchain and record any concrete obstacle.

### Restrict generic trusted models

<!-- guideline: restrict-generic-trusted-models -->

Trait bounds and external trait declarations alone do not establish a model's
semantic laws. Inspect associated types, aliasing, and interior mutability; limit trusted
contracts to reviewed type and architecture combinations.

If the external signature must remain generic, guard its guarantees with a
model-validity predicate admitted only for reviewed instances. Include relevant
storage, ordering, and index types.

For example, PR #742 limits its immutable `Seq<bool>` model to `bitvec` storage
`u8`, `u32`, `usize`, and `u64` on 64-bit targets, with `Lsb0`. `BitStore` alone
is insufficient because some implementations allow mutation through shared
references.

### Distinguish spec and exec indexing

<!-- guideline: distinguish-spec-and-exec-indexing -->

`Seq::spec_index` is total, with unspecified out-of-bounds values. Spec helpers
can use this behavior; retain bounds when the claimed property needs a valid
index, and explicit triggers when needed for reliable instantiation.

Executable indexing still requires non-panicking bounds through `requires` or
`IndexSpec::index_req`. A model of executable `get` must preserve its `Option`
success/failure semantics; unspecified spec values do not replace that contract.

[#742](https://github.com/asterinas/vostd/pull/742#discussion_r3947311108).

### Reuse existing specifications

<!-- guideline: reuse-existing-specifications -->

Search the active `vstd` and `vstd_extra` APIs before adding helpers, axioms, or
external specifications. Use existing spec-enabled operations, such as
`saturating_add`, directly. Extend incomplete support at the narrowest reusable
layer rather than introducing overlapping models.

When a checked proof replaces an axiom, call it directly and remove obsolete
wrappers and bridge lemmas. Retain compatibility lemmas only for abstraction
boundaries that current callers need.

### Canonical spec models

<!-- guideline: canonical-spec-models -->

Choose the simplest standard mathematical type that faithfully represents the
executable value. Prefer `Range<int>` for an integer range, `Map` for a map
view, and a sequence plus a position for an ordered cursor when those models
capture the required semantics directly.

Make type-level properties independent of irrelevant value arguments, and make
predicates methods when they describe the well-formedness of one model.

[#704](https://github.com/asterinas/vostd/pull/704#discussion_r3767737737).

### Quantifiers and triggers

<!-- guideline: quantifiers-and-triggers -->

Prefer standard predicates such as `Seq::all` when they express the property
directly. Their predicate-based triggers can reduce unnecessary instantiations
compared with broad index triggers such as `s[i]`. Check the predicate's
definition and verify the effect in the actual proof context.

Use a subrange predicate when it improves readability; retain an explicit
quantifier when it better supports indexing or triggers. Do not add an axiom
for a fact derivable from the sequence definition merely to support this change.

[#742](https://github.com/asterinas/vostd/pull/742#discussion_r3947117794).

### Implement Inv for models

<!-- guideline: implement-inv-for-models -->

When a spec-level model has an intrinsic validity invariant, implement the
`Inv` trait and define it through `inv()`:

```rust
impl Inv for Model {
    open spec fn inv(self) -> bool {
        // The model invariant.
    }
}
```

Require `inv()` before operations that assume a valid state and ensure it after
operations that promise to preserve validity. For mutable operations, state
this as `old(self).inv()` and `final(self).inv()` where appropriate.

Use a separate `wf(...)` predicate only for well-formedness relationships that
depend on another value. Making fields private provides representation hiding;
it does not cause Verus to establish `inv()` automatically.
