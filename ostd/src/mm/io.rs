//! Abstractions for reading and writing virtual memory (VM) objects.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The core virtual memory (VM) access APIs provided by this module are [`VmReader`] and
//! [`VmWriter`], which allow for writing to or reading from a region of memory _safely_.
//! `VmReader` and `VmWriter` objects can be constructed from memory regions of either typed memory
//! (e.g., `&[u8]`) or untyped memory (e.g, [`UFrame`]). Behind the scene, `VmReader` and `VmWriter`
//! must be constructed via their [`from_user_space`] and [`from_kernel_space`] methods, whose
//! safety depends on whether the given memory regions are _valid_ or not.
//!
//! [`UFrame`]: crate::mm::UFrame
//! [`from_user_space`]: `VmReader::from_user_space`
//! [`from_kernel_space`]: `VmReader::from_kernel_space`
//!
//! Here is a list of conditions for memory regions to be considered valid:
//!
//! - The memory region as a whole must be either typed or untyped memory, not both typed and
//!   untyped.
//!
//! - If the memory region is typed, we require that:
//!   - the [validity requirements] from the official Rust documentation must be met, and
//!   - the type of the memory region (which must exist since the memory is typed) must be
//!     plain-old-data, so that the writer can fill it with arbitrary data safely.
//!
//! [validity requirements]: core::ptr#safety
//!
//! - If the memory region is untyped, we require that:
//!   - the underlying pages must remain alive while the validity requirements are in effect, and
//!   - the kernel must access the memory region using only the APIs provided in this module, but
//!     external accesses from hardware devices or user programs do not count.
//!
//! We have the last requirement for untyped memory to be valid because the safety interaction with
//! other ways to access the memory region (e.g., atomic/volatile memory loads/stores) is not
//! currently specified. Tis may be relaxed in the future, if appropriate and necessary.
//!
//! Note that data races on untyped memory are explicitly allowed (since pages can be mapped to
//! user space, making it impossible to avoid data races). However, they may produce erroneous
//! results, such as unexpected bytes being copied, but do not cause soundness problems.
