//! Proof model for CPU-local state.
//!
//! A CPU-local object is modeled as one logical value for every CPU in its
//! configured domain.
//! [`CpuLocalAuth`] owns the authoritative map, while
//! [`CpuLocalPointsTo`] is the exclusive points-to resource for one CPU's
//! entry. Distinct CPUs therefore have independently owned resources and may
//! operate on them concurrently.
//!
//! This module only defines the resource algebra used by CPU-local clients. It
//! does not yet connect the resources to executable CPU-local storage,
//! preemption guards, or scheduler transitions. Those layers should keep the
//! authority in an invariant and transfer each points-to resource
//! into the corresponding CPU core's proof state.
