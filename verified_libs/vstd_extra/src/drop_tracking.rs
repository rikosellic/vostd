/// drop-permission checking.

/// establishing all of the following properties in their concrete

///
/// - an issued obligation is associated with the value for which it was
///   issued;
/// - the obligation cannot be forged or duplicated;
/// - the state records enough authoritative information to detect a lost
///   outstanding obligation; and
/// - [`Drop::drop`] consumes the obligation and performs the corresponding
