/// obligation ledger — e.g. `Range<Paddr>` for a `Segment<M>`, `usize` for a
/// per-slot resource, `()` for impls that pipe the token through without a
/// per-instance ledger. Two-layer enforcement (the design that survives
/// Verus's affineness):
///
/// 1. **Token (this type)**: an `ExclusiveGhost<R>` wrapper. Each `alloc`
///    produces a unique [`Loc`]; two outstanding tokens can be proven
///    distinct via [`DropObligation::validate_with_other`]. No external_body
///    axioms — the allocation is verified by `vstd`'s resource algebra.
/// 2. **Ledger (in State)**: optional. For impls that opt in, the State
///    carries a set/multiset of outstanding keys; mint adds, redeem removes,
///    and the State's `clean_inv()` (or any boundary predicate) requires the
///    set to be empty (or the per-slot counter to be zero). Combined with
///    `1`, the linear guarantee is sound: silently dropping the token leaves
///    the ledger non-empty and breaks the boundary check.
///
/// Impls that don't add a per-state ledger still pass tokens through —
/// they get the API uniformity but not the enforcement.
